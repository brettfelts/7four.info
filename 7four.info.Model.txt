The website should contain 5 features/funtionalities. A login form, a create an account form, a change settings feature and a 
publish content form. When the user creates an account they will have access to the publish content form in which they can publish their 
articles or short stories. They will also, when they need or want to, be able to change their user settings such as password and email. 
When the user chooses to publish their content they will choose a category from a list and go from there as you can see from the publish content 
model below the change email model.
